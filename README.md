This project is for Plus Bus Dunedin.
This website is made using Svelte.

This project is being hosted on github.com
To work on this project you must:

clone the repo https://github.com/legin8/plus-bus-dunedin/tree/working
Assuming you have npm installed on your computer, if not download it,
from the root of the repo: npm install
Then create a branch and start working from there.
Use: npm run dev
To check your work as you code, then once it's ready merge into staging.

From the staging branch: npm run build
Then: npm run preview
This will let you see what the deployed branch will look like, if all is well.
npm run deploy
This can be done from any branch to update the gh-pages and the site will be deployed from their once the checks have been done.
Warnning the changes arn't instant, you may have to wait a few minutes for the old site to be updated so don't panic thinking you have done something wrong, just wait for github to do its thing.

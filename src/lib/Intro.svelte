    <h2>What we do</h2>
    <div>
      <p>At Plus Bus we provide a "door-to-door service" to help the elderly and people who struggled using public transport to get groceries home from the supermarket.</p>
      <p>Clients are picked up from their home in a van, the van can carry up to nine passengers at a time.
        A volunteer helper will carry groceries back into your house.</p>
